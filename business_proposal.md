## Technical Summary 
### For more information, please see the included notes.md file

* Tested RBM ability to learn & generate spin structure of H2 molecule and get somewhat sufficient result.
* Checked if RBM can also learn wave function of Rydberg atom. Shows task criteria is not so well defined and is impossible to achieve, then propose a criteria to see maximum ability of RBM in this task. Also saw that the number of training data is very critical to final model performance.
* Tested how the contrastive divergence (CD) approximation method used while training & sampling RBM affects the final model performance, and shows the steps for block Gibbs sampling greatly affects the training process.
* Tried to learn D-Wave output spin structure using RBM. It seems that we can learn that size of configurations(~2000) relatively fast using GPU. 
* We also show the training almost reaches an equilibrium state.

## Procedures 

### Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise

* Finding the electronic structure of materials using quantum machine learning.

### Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

* We expect this approach to revolutionizing materials discovery to be applied in multiple industries as the hardware gets more powerful. 
* For example, this can be helpful in drug discovery, creating new thin film materials for solar panels, designing materials for better energy storage in batteries etc.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

### Examples:
    * TSLA
    * Merck
    * Dupont
    * 3M 

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language
