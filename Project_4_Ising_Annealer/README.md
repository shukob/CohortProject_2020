## Project 4: Ising Annealing

Your final week's project will guide you through the process of mapping an electronic structure Hamiltonian to a classical Ising model, and then solving for the groundstate of the model using a thermal anneling Monte Carlo simulation.

A very brief introduction to the main ideas behind the project, and the basics of the Monte Carlo method are
[here.](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/CDL_2020_docs.pdf)

In our [Project4_LandingPage.pdf](https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2020/blob/master/Project_4_Ising_Annealer/Project4_LandingPage.pdf),
we provide more technical information the Ising Hamiltonians involved.
Click on this link to begin learning about your tasks for this week!

## Tasks include:
* Perform thermal annealing to solve for the groundstate of a ferromagnetic Ising model.
* Perform thermal annealing to solve for the groundstate of disordered Ising models.
* Apply what you have learned to solve the Hydrogen molecule groundstate.

## Further Challenges: 
* Explore the annealing procedure on the Mattis glass.
* Devise a 2-local Ising Hamiltonian for the Hydrogen molecule, and compare your results.
* Solve your 2-local Hamiltonian (or any Hamiltonian) on open-source commercial software, and compare the performance.
* Go wild and try thermal annealing on your favorite NP-hard problem!

## Business Application
One again, your team is asked to complete a Business Application. Questions you will be asked are:

* Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise.
* Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
* Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
* Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language.

For more details refer to the [Business Application found here](./Business_Application.md)

## Presenting your results in your pull request
For your pull request, consider the following for the presentation of your final results:
- Work entirely in the directory for Project 4.
- Edit this README.md file with a highlight of your main technical results.  Provide links to any other files with your detailed results, e.g. Jupyter notebooks.
- For your Business Application, feel free to provide your answers directly in the 
[Business_Application.md](./Business_Application.md) file.
- Do not directly upload your video file (or any other large files) to the repository.  Instead, provide a link e.g. to a YouTube video, or a Google Drive file.
- Include a file contributions.md that lists the contributions of each group member.
